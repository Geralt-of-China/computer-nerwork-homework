a) source port: 33000, dest port: 80
b) source prot: 80, dest port:33000
c) No
d) Yes

p2.
Suppose the IP address of the hosts A,B and C are a,b,c respectively.
To host A:Source port=80,source IP address = b,dest port =26145,dest IP address=a.
To host C, left process source port=80,source IP address = b, dest port =7532, dest IP address=c.
To host C, right process: source port=80,source IP address=b, dest port =26145, dest IP address=c.

p3.
01010011+01100110=10111001
10111001+01110100=00101110
1s complement is  11010001.
To detec errors,the receiver adds the four words, if the sum contains a zero,the receiver knows there is 
an error. All one-bit error can be detected,but two-bit error can not be detected.

p5.
NO, because the way checksum is used can only detect one-bit error,if two corresponding bits change from 
1 and 0 to 0 and 1, the sum still remains the same. In this circumstance,the checksum verfity even there is
an error.
