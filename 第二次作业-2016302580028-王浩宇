P21 YES,we can use dig to query that web site in the local DNS server. For example, "dig baidu.com" will return the 
query time for finding baidu.com. If baidu.com was just accessed a couple of seconds age, an entry for baidu.com is cached in the 
local DNS cache, so the query time is 0 msec. Otherwise, the query time is large.
